This repository contains the files and documentation related to the analysis and dimensioning of the 
low voltage electrical installations for the substation at the Hospital de Clínicas of the Federal 
University of Uberlândia (HC-UFU), developed using Siemens SIMARIS Design software.

The materials provided here serve as the foundation for the article entitled:
"Analysis and Dimensioning of Low Voltage Electrical Installations in a Brazilian University Hospital 
Using SIMARIS Software", which presents a technical and critical approach to the use of SIMARIS in a hospital setting.

The file "HC-UFU_Original Project.pdf" contains the simulation of the project based on data made 
available through the hospital’s public procurement process, with no modifications.

The file "HC-UFU_New_Sizing.pdf" presents the redesigned substation, including all corrections made 
to address inconsistencies found in the original project.
